GMSimplePLayer is a customizable view player. You can customize It via code or via Interface Builder. 
To use It you can create an instance with Its initializer or just add a GMPlayer view to your .xib file.

## Example

To run the example project, follow these steps:
1 - clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/GastonMontes/GMSimplePlayer.git`.
2 - Change to Example folder: `cd GMSimplePlayer/Example/`.
3 - Install pods: `pod install`.
4 - Open Workspace: `open GMSimplePlayer.xcworkspace`.

## Requirements

| GMSimplePlayer Version |     Minimum iOS Target      |      Minimum OS X Target     |              Notes               |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|         1.0.0          |           iOS 9.0           |           OS X 10.10.4       |        Xcode 8 required.         |

## Installation

### 1) Download CocoaPods
-----------------------
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for iOS, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects.

CocoaPods is distributed as a ruby gem, and is installed by running the following commands in Terminal.app:

```ruby
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

### 2) Create Podfile
-------------------
In the project root folder, run the following command to create a Podfile:

```ruby
$ pod init
```

If an `YOURXCODEPROJECTFILE` project file is specified or if there is only a single project file in the current directory, targets will be automatically generated based on targets defined in the project.

## 3) Add dependencies:
An empty Podfile was created, so we are going to add dependencies to the Podfile specifying pods versions:

To use the latest version of a Pod, ommit the version specification:
```ruby
pod 'GMSimplePlayer'
```

Freezing to a specific Pod version:
```ruby
pod 'GMSimplePlayer', '1.0.0'
```

Using `logical` operators:
- `'> 0.1'`, Any version higher than 0.1.
- `'>= 0.1'`, Any version higher or equal to 0.1.
- `'< 0.1'`, Any version lower than 0.1.
- `'<= 0.1'`, Any version lower or equal to 0.1.

Using `optimistic` operators:
- `'~> 0.1.0'`, Version 0.1.0 or higher up to 0.2, not including 0.2.
- `'~> 0.1'`, Version 0.1 or higher up to 1.0, not including 1.0.

### 4) Install dependencies
-------------------------
Install Pods dependencies in your project. Run the following commands:

```ruby
$ pod install
```

From now on, be sure to always open the generated Xcode workspace (.xcworkspace) instead of the project file when building your project.
